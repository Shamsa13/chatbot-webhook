Kathleen Taylor - Board Chair Series
===

[00:00:00] 

Quinn Lawson: Welcome to the second quarter of this century. This is the premier episode of the Board Chair series, created by David Beatie and produced by me Quinn Lawson. To introduce David, I wanna share, uh, bank of Canada Governor Tiff MLA's reference from their time together at Rotman. Governor MLA noted that competition to get into David's courses were always fierce.

Quinn Lawson: Adding that his students were always left with new skills, new capacities, and new inspiration. That through his deep commitment, boundless energy and genuine curiosity, David changed the landscape and he has had a profound impact in boardrooms across Canada and beyond. Well, what better qualities to continue today as we aim to embody them in our series and board chair community?

Quinn Lawson: This 2026 board chair series is dedicated to hosting top performing chairs and creating a space where they can bring [00:01:00] back and share candid feel notes. This is a brisk one hour session. We're gonna wrap up at 1 58. Uh, and so please add your questions to the chat and let's jump in for today's session.

Quinn Lawson: David will interview Katie, followed by a one-on-one discussion, and then we'll open the floor to a few questions. Professor Beatty, please take it away. 

David Beatty: Well, thank you Quinn, and happy New Year to everyone. And a special big hello to Kathleen Taylor. I can't imagine a Canadian who has had more experience in more different boardrooms as both an executive, a director, and a chair.

David Beatty: So Kathy, thank you so very much for joining us today. Let's start off with some simple things like, um, what do you remember about your first director role? 

Katie: Oh, I remember my first director role very well, David. And first off, before I dive into that, thanks so much for having me on the podcast and happy New year to all of our, uh, all of our listeners, and thanks for being with us.

Katie: [00:02:00] My first director role was back in the late nineties when I was a senior executive at Four Seasons. Not yet the president of Worldwide Business Operations and the Eaton family came to Izzy Sharp and said, we're gonna go public again. Uh, and we would like to build a new board, and we need, uh, some women for that board.

Katie: Uh, we're wondering if, uh, Katie would be the, uh, the candidate for that. Um, Izzy talked to me about it. I said, oh, this sounds very interesting. So I joined the board. In the early part of 19, uh, 1998, you'll, both of you who have good memories will recall that the company had just emerged from a bankruptcy filing.

Katie: Uh, done its restructuring, and we were gung-ho to, uh, to drive growth in the business. Uh, going forward, we had a brand new, uh, CEO George Uch that we'd recruited away from, uh, from the Hudson's Bay Company. So we went public on June the 10th. Um, after a short stint of getting ready with prospectuses and the like, um, [00:03:00] by, uh, by June 30 we were doing a little bit more restructuring.

Katie: And by September 11th, uh, we were already in profit forecast revisioning. So it was a very, very difficult first few months. By November 16th of the same year, uh, our CEO, our much lauded CEO had resigned. Uh, and by the end of that year we were preparing for another restructuring. The company eventually filed again in August of 1999.

Katie: So if, uh, uh, I said to David, I've done a whole class on this at Rotman, uh, the governance learnings from everything that went on in that, uh, in that just over 12 month period for me. Uh, and it was a, uh, uh, a very, very interesting baptism into the world of corporate boards 

David Beatty: and time consuming too, I would guess.

David Beatty: Katie, you must have spent a half your life there. 

Katie: Well, that goes to, to, 

David Beatty: one of 

Katie: the learnings was, uh, when you're joining a board, you know, really think about, uh, about [00:04:00] independence on the board. Um, in the end, yeah. It turned out that we only had two truly independent directors myself and, and the much, uh, the much awarded Phil Orino, um, the, oh yeah.

Katie: Brothers, obviously non independent. Our CFO was not independent. And our, our then chair, Brent Valentine, became our interim CEO. So also not independent. So when all of this work came around, Katie and Phil, um, were on point. 

David Beatty: Wow. So in 2001, you then joined the RBC board. That's correct. And was it, yeah. Was it then filled only with operating CEOs or describe the board as you found it because it had just transformed itself from being CEO chair led by Mr.

David Beatty: Cleghorn to having David O'Brien take over, or no, I guess not. David hadn't taken over. We, John was still chair. CEO 

Katie: Well, no, when Gordon Nixon became our CEO, uh, then, [00:05:00] uh, then our, we had an independent chair, um, and, uh, um, Ms. Spire from, uh, from Montreal. Um, and, uh, and, and ultimately that was when the roles were split.

Katie: So this was, uh, 2001, I think was Gord's first year as CEO. He was, uh, in, uh, in the mindset of adding new people to the board. Um, and, uh, and approached, uh, approached me about, uh, about standing for candidacy. 

David Beatty: Wonderful. Yeah. And you stayed there for a full, I think 13 years before you became the chair, is that correct?

Katie: Yes. So joined in, uh, joined in 2001 was named chair in August of 2013. Officially took over from David O'Brien in January of 14. 

David Beatty: And you had previously though, being chair of audit, chair of hr, chair of governance. You'd done all of the intermediate jobs in that time period, right? Yeah, 

Katie: well I served as a, a member of the audit committee.

Katie: Yeah. I I became chair of the [00:06:00] HR committee. Um, yeah. And, uh, and ultimately also served on the corporate governance committee and, uh, and the risk committee, um, before I became chair. 

David Beatty: A risk. Yes. Right. Good for you. So you had a pretty thorough knowledge of the business of the bank outta the hospitality industry by the time somebody said, let's make you the chair.

David Beatty: That's correct. I'd, uh, 

Katie: I'd, I'd learned the, uh, the business as best, as best you can when you're not running it. Um, but also, uh, yeah, had learned the people and the culture, which is, uh, which is a very important part of, uh, being an effective director. 

David Beatty: And how did you get to be chair? How did that election occur?

David Beatty: Were you asked to leave the room and hands went up, or what do you, what happened? 

Katie: Well, in that particular case, um, the planning for, uh, David O'Brien's succession had started a couple of years earlier. And so, uh, part me becoming chair of the Human Resources Committee was, uh, the idea that we had to get more and, uh, next generation folks into those [00:07:00] committee chairs.

Katie: Um, you know, I often say that that board succession planning, particularly around committee succession planning, chair succession planning is quite serious business. Um, it's long-term business and it needs attention. And so I was asked to take on the hr, uh, chair role, I think largely to see whether or not I had the leadership chops that were required to become chair of the board.

Katie: Um, when the time eventually came, uh, David O'Brien, um, did a canvas of, uh, of the board. Of the, of the people who were ready, willing and able to, uh, take on the role. Um, and ultimately it was a great honor to be selected by my colleagues. 

David Beatty: Yeah, the first female chair of a large Canadian bank and the largest single company in the Toronto Stock Exchange.

David Beatty: Congratulations. It's quite a crew. And were you reviewed every year by the board or every three years, or were there external evaluations of your performance? 

Katie: Oh yeah. Fair. As board, as board chair, part of the, uh, board evaluation process was chair evaluation. [00:08:00] Um, okay. And so the, uh, the chair of the governance committee, um, which, uh, I, when I took first, took over as board chair, the governance committee chair and the board chair were the same person.

Katie: Um, yep. One of my first, uh, first uh, decisions, um, with the encouragement of my colleagues was to split those rules. Um, and Heather Monroe Bloom became the, uh, the governance chair there. And she was, uh, she was very, very, very, um, helpful in, uh, one getting me settled as a brand new, uh, as a brand new board chair.

Katie: Yeah. But over the years, um, was, uh, able to, uh, garner feedback from colleagues on things that they thought I was doing well, things that I could be doing better. Um, it was not a shy board, so much of the feedback would come direct as well. Uh, but we did have a very, uh, a very formal evaluation process, not only for me, but for the entire board.

David Beatty: Okay. And what was your biggest learning through those nine years of evaluations about your own performance, what you [00:09:00] needed do more of, and what you maybe should have done less of? 

Katie: Well, I think the, uh, the biggest learning is, is, uh, for being a board chair is you don't know what you don't know. Um, if, for me, this was my first time, uh, chairing the board of a public company, and obviously as you point out of a very significant public company with complex operations and, and, uh, and a large and, and very, uh, very dedicated board.

Katie: So, um, the, the learning of what goes into being a great chair, um, is, is something that you kind of find your feet on. Uh, I do today, do a lot of, uh, chats, coffee chats with people who are taking on these roles for the first time. Share a lot of, uh, of feedback around that. Um, and, uh, and really try to help people because those, those, the first year or two, um, you are learning the process of being a board chair.

Katie: You're learning what it takes to manage the board. [00:10:00] You're getting to know your colleagues in a very, very different way than you may have before. 

David Beatty: Yeah, yeah. It's a multidimensional, uh, transformation that occurs in terms of, of, um, examples of directors who you really admired and respected and learned from.

David Beatty: Could, could you give us any specific names from your past? Oh, well, the list is 

Katie: probably, uh, too long and I wouldn't wanna leave anybody out. But if you think about the, the boards I've had the privilege to serve on Yep. Um, some fantastic directors that I had the privilege of working with at RBCI was also served on the CPP investments board for almost 10 years.

David Beatty: Okay. 

Katie: Um, and, uh, and that board, um, although not a public company, uh, operates at the highest standards of governance, um mm-hmm. And, uh, not only in terms of its processes, but also in terms of its selection. Um, so through that, I got to know directors on both sides of the border, literally across every province in the country.

Katie: [00:11:00] Um, very, very privileged. And today I serve on the Air Canada Board, the, uh, the Adecco board in Zurich. Um, uh, again, both with, uh, with very, uh, geographically and, and otherwise diverse, uh, diverse operators. So it's a, uh. It's been a, it's been a wonderful education for me, not only in my own learning, but to learn from colleagues.

David Beatty: Yeah. Terrific. Um, in terms of, of, I, I always think of the job of the chair as being to be in a way the best friend of the CEO. If the chair's CEO relationship is not functioning, basically nothing's gonna work. You agree with that? And what did you do to make that happen in your case with Gord and then Dave?

Katie: I absolutely do agree with that. In fact, um, when I joined the Element board, it was with the, with the intention of me becoming the chair. And, uh, that was a new dynamic as well because I'm a brand new director, um, and I'm coming in from the outside. David Denison, one of those very revered, [00:12:00] uh, corporate directors was the one who recruited me to replace him there.

Katie: Um, and one of the things I said to him was, well, first things first. Um, we need to find out whether or not Laura, uh, and I actually really, really, really like each other and are going to get along from a, uh, mindset strategy. Working process perspective because you can't, you can't, um, make a success out of a board chair.

Katie: And I maybe even argue CEOs become more successful when they have the right chairs in place as well, so could not be a more critical relationship. 

David Beatty: Yeah. So what did you, how did you make that work? Say with, uh, with, with Gordon Nixon or Dave McKay at, at the RBC, did you have an office in the RBC? Do you have a secretary?

David Beatty: Do you see them every day, every week, every month? How, yeah. Talk a little bit about the nature of the, and frequency of the interchanges. 

Katie: Sure. So Gordon and I were, were together for a very short period of time, because you remember [00:13:00] I was announced in August of 13. Then Gordon announced his retirement, um, later that fall with the transition that happened the following August.

Katie: So I would say for the bulk of my time as chair at RBCI was working with Dave Mackay. And so, yeah. The job there was in early days for the two of us to get to know each other better. Um, Dave had been a member of the executive committee, but, uh, but not somebody that I was dealing with day to day in my, uh, role as chair of the HR committee.

Katie: So I would say time, uh, is a big factor here, like in any relationship building exercise, um, the time that you set aside to spend with each other, to talk about the business, to talk about the people, talk about the challenges. Mm-hmm. Talk about the opportunities. Um, but honestly to get to know each other in the way each other thinks is a critical, uh, a critical element of that too.

Katie: Um, in terms of how we, uh, we structured it, um, obviously the CEO of a [00:14:00] big, of Canada's largest corporation at the time and, and a huge financial institution has a bitty pretty busy schedule. So we obviously kept flexibility to speak to one another anytime we needed to. But we did have a very, uh, a very set schedule for, uh, for getting together.

Katie: Um, usually in person, obviously the pandemic in, in interrupted, uh, that and changed things a little bit. But generally speaking, we would, we would hold our meetings in person, so, uh. The obvious ones would be pre-board and post board. Um, yep. Mm-hmm. That were, uh, that were critical to getting us set up for success in, uh, using the board's time very effectively.

Katie: And then coming back with, uh, what worked, what needs more work, what needs to come back, what were some of the, uh, the in-camera discussions that may be unfolded. Um, so those would be, would be set, um, and, uh, and well programmed. And then we would always have another meeting in between, um, that was also scheduled and set, uh, in person.

Katie: [00:15:00] We called that the midpoint. Um, and that we would just get together to make sure that we were. Both in sync, um, and that I was caught up on anything that was, uh, emerging in, in the business. Um, I did have an office at the bank. I, I, uh, my office was, uh, with the corporate secretariat who I spent an awful lot of time with.

Katie: Um, yep. Right. Getting ready for board meetings. Both, both, uh, you know, in the, in the planning of the agendas, the planning of the, uh, the outline of the time. Uh, and then obviously, um, talking afterwards about, alright, we gotta get set up for the next meeting. Banks meet very frequently, um, as you well know David more frequently than other boards.

Katie: So the minute you're finished the, the February meeting, you're already planning for, for the next, 

David Beatty: yeah. Right. So your office was on the same floor as, uh, Dave's or in a different floor, so you No, same, same building, 

Katie: different floor. Okay. Um, but, uh, but you know. I don't know. He was on eight. I was on [00:16:00] 12. I moved around because the bank was renovating the, uh, the offices while I was chair in the early years.

Katie: So sometimes on nine, sometimes on 12, sometimes in, uh, in the North Tower, but easy proximity. Um, and I would say my, my access to Dave was, was unfettered. And my, uh, my relationship with his, uh, with his fantastic EA was also very strong. So if I needed him or he needed me, um, we, we had a way of making that happen.

David Beatty: Yeah. That's terrific. Well done. Yes. I think without that, um, not so much cordiality openness, transparency and, and complete honestness about what's going on and what's happening and what's on my mind or what's on your mind. Yes. Nothing's gonna work at the board. So did he start off board meetings by having sort of a half hour harvest CEO today?

David Beatty: Yes. We, we would. 

Katie: We'd start our board meetings, um, uh, with an hour in camera with Dave, sometimes an hour and a half, [00:17:00] depending on what was on the agenda. Wow. It would, it would really depend if we were, you know, kind of in the middle of a, uh, quite a big strategic set of decisions or perhaps an acquisition, um, whatever it might be.

Katie: It would really depend. Again, part of pre-board would be what's on Dave's list, what's likely to be on the board's list? How much time do we need for that? And, and really trying to manage to, again, optimum use of, of the board's time. 

David Beatty: Yeah, that's great. I always use the word, uh, invest as opposed to how did we spend time, how did we invest time in order to imply the notion of a return to the organization from our time investment.

David Beatty: So I always thought of the, the agenda as the biggest investment decision the chair makes because if you are allocating the time ineffectively, you really are not gonna get any value out to the company. Right. 

Katie: I could not agree more. Yeah. I, I always say to people that time is a board's time together [00:18:00] is a board's scarcest resource because it's already set it, you can't make it longer.

Katie: Um, you can make it shorter if you have that opportunity, but it's very difficult, right? People fly in from different places, they've got other commitments. So you've gotta figure out how to get the best out of that, uh, out of that group for the time you have them together. 

David Beatty: Yeah, exactly. That's super. Now, occasionally on boards, you get somebody who takes up a little too much airtime or perhaps somebody who is a little too quiet when in fact there's a lot of potential value.

David Beatty: Add the end of a board meeting. How did you, how did you handle those things? Or did you ever have that as a, as a, as a challenge. 

Katie: Yeah, I think on every board there's always a challenge with, uh, with, with making sure that everybody's contributing effectively. Um, nobody's adding, uh, the phrase I like to use is a adding too much value, um, in, uh, in certain sets of circumstances.

Katie: [00:19:00] Um, and, uh, and, and sometimes you do have to deal with that. Largely for me, um, those were things that I would deal with through regular meetings with my colleagues, um, coaching that would come out of the, uh. The board effectiveness surveys that we would do every year. 

David Beatty: Okay. Yep. 

Katie: Um, we would, uh, use a third party to do the surveys.

Katie: Um, we did peer surveys every year. Um Wow. So people were getting feedback from colleagues. And oftentimes I would also, um, have feedback from colleagues because I would do a one-on-one with all, all the board members each year to get, oh, you did Okay. Their additional feedback that they maybe didn't feel comfortable writing into the survey or some color that they wanted to add, or sometimes I would have specific questions for them.

Katie: Um, but that was a great opportunity where if you had a director who was, as you say, potentially taking up too much air time or somebody who wasn't, um, [00:20:00] necessarily, uh, you weren't necessarily feeling like they were bringing their all, um, there was great opportunity there to coach, um, your colleagues to, uh, to get them to, uh, to.

Katie: The highest level of their potential performance. 

David Beatty: Yeah. So you met with every individual director one-on-one at least once a year then? Yes. Well, good for you. And I would 

Katie: generally go travel to there, so, ah, if, if they had an office here in Toronto, I would try to go see them in their natural habitat.

Katie: Mm-hmm. Make it as easy as possible for people. Obviously if it was out of town directors, I would tend to do that, um, either on Zoom, um, to the extent that was in invented then. Yeah. Or we would have a, a meal or a coffee or something when they were in town for a board cycle. 

David Beatty: Okay. So if you estimated that, say a normal director of a banks invested 300 hours a year, is the chair going to be [00:21:00] investing 50% more than that four 50?

David Beatty: Or what would you guess? 

Katie: Oh, you know what, I never really thought about it in terms mm-hmm. Of sort of time and materials that way. Uh, when I took on the role at Royal, it was, um, as I said earlier, a great honor. Um, a job I'd never done before. And one that I wasn't necessarily educated in a formal sense on how to do, um, the only, mm-hmm.

Katie: Uh, touchstones I had were watching other chairs, um, who had, uh, who had done it before me. So I knew that I had a very steep learning curve, not only in the chair role mm-hmm. But also getting to know the bank in a way that would make me feel like I was doing my job correctly. So I set it up essentially to say.

Katie: Um. Royal Bank is my number one priority, and they essentially have unlimited access to my time. Um, and so in that regard, [00:22:00] um, I gave my administrative assistant at the bank, um, access to my email, access to my calendar, access to my life, um, so that they would have first call on my time. Yeah. And I decided, um, early in that, uh, in that piece I, I'd agreed to join the CPP board, but I said that was it.

Katie: I'm not doing anything else for at least one year until I know I have my feet underneath me. Um, yeah. And I know what kind of time and attention this job is going to take. Uh, and, and in, in, in the be with the benefit of hindsight that, that worked well for me. I had CPP. As a very, uh, established and professional board where I was also learning.

Katie: I obviously had my own board at Four Seasons that, that I learned from. I mentioned the Eden's board. I was also on the Sick Kids Board and the philanthropy. Philanthropy space. Um, but, but the decision to really keep my, um, [00:23:00] my, uh, responsibilities at that point, um, very manageable until I knew what I was, uh, what I needed to do.

Katie: And we got into our rhythm with the CEO, with the corporate secretary, with the team. Um, it was, it, it gave me the space to do the learning I needed to do. 

David Beatty: Yeah. And there's always, always a challenge that possibly there be some crisis that takes your entire life up on a board of directors. That is the 

Katie: piece of coaching I give to everybody who's starting out in their board career, which is, yeah, make sure you leave a lot of white space in your life.

Katie: Because if your CEO comes and says, oh, I've decided, which happened to us at CPP, um, I've decided to take a role elsewhere, all of a sudden now you are into CEO Search and succession. Um, yeah, and as you know from your experience, these are very, very time consuming and it doesn't have to be that, it could be a big acquisition, it could be a restructuring, it could be any number of things.

Katie: Yeah. But yes, making sure you have a lot of [00:24:00] elasticity in, in your time. 

David Beatty: White space, different topic culture. Mm-hmm. Um, what actually happens in the bank on the day-to-day street and you, around the boardroom table, you pretty much eat what you're fed by the management team. Mm-hmm. What have you done to encourage your directors to get to know more about the bank and the bank people and how the bank actually, actually runs, in fact?

Katie: Yeah. Well, I'd say we, we do a few things. Some of them would be, uh, some of them would be template, but, uh, directors receive the morning media feed, so you're constantly up to date on all the news, both related to your institution, but also related to the industry. Um, in addition to that education sessions, which, uh, which most high performing boards are doing on topical issues.

Katie: Um, on top of that, encouraging the senior team to make sure they're bringing their high potential and, and, uh, and, and, mm-hmm. Critical. Team members with them to [00:25:00] presentations and giving them the opportunity to speak with the board and giving the board the opportunity to, to exchange with them. Uh, one of the things we started to do, um, which, uh, which was very, uh, very well received, if we had a special presentation from, uh, one of the business operations or one of the functions, sometimes that evening, um, the board dinner would be centered.

Katie: On perfect that team, not the senior people, but the next level down. And it was really a very useful, um, uh, enterprise for us. It was, uh, not threatening because we were just trying to get to know these, uh, young, high potential folks. Um, gave us a chance to ask them about the work they were doing. Get to know them a little bit.

Katie: Um, they probably, if they were high potential, actually showed up later as somebody who was getting a promotion into a, into a, into a next level job. And so we already know them then. And then, but I think the, the last thing [00:26:00] is it gives them an opportunity to demystify the board and ask us questions about what does the board do?

Katie: Yeah. How are you thinking? How can we help you be more effective in your work? So it was, uh, it was very useful. I also think, um, a couple of times a year we would go offsite, sometimes in connection with the AGM sometimes. Yeah. Um, it would be in a visit to our New York office or our LA office or our London office where we have, uh, we have significant operations and significant people.

Katie: Um, and that gave us an opportunity sometimes to spend time with the, uh, with the clients 

David Beatty: mm-hmm. Of 

Katie: the organization, but always to spend time with the teams in these. Uh, foreign theaters of operation, which is a very important element, um, of, of understanding your culture. 

David Beatty: So if I was on your board and traveling to London, I would probably follow a process of phoning you and saying, I'd like to meet some of the executives over there.

David Beatty: Can you talk to Ka to Dave and [00:27:00] see who he recommends? Would that be the channel that I ought to use as a director? 

Katie: Well, we would set up those, those, um, uh, offsite or, or foreign office meetings with that already in mind. So we would have, um, uh, receptions, we would have, uh, um, presentations. The, the focus of the meeting.

Katie: We would generally do that meeting, um, in the absence of a quarter. So we weren't burdened with all of the, uh. Regulatory compliance and disclosure issues. So we pick one of the dates, yeah, October, January where the two were, where we had meetings without quarters, and we really focus the agenda, pick London on the businesses that we are in, in London, the people who are running those businesses in London, um, and really make them the focus of our time there.

Katie: What happened?

Quinn Lawson: I'm not sure what happened there, [00:28:00] Katie. Um, I, uh, I have some questions while we're waiting for David to jump back in. 

Katie: Okay. 

Quinn Lawson: Would you add 

Katie: ask 

Quinn Lawson: Oh, yep, go ahead. Uh, you were touching on RBC, so, so a couple questions related to that. Um, as the chair, would you participate in strategy development at RBC? 

Katie: As the chair, not, not specifically away from board members, no, I didn't have a, a differential status with management on strategy, um, in terms of the, uh, substance of strategy, um, that was management's role.

Katie: Um, the one place that I, I, I did sort of lean in was on the process, uh, for strategic review and for, uh, strategic, uh, for strategic extensions. Uh, whether that would be a new product line, a [00:29:00] new business line, perhaps a, an acquisition. It could be those things. One of the things that I always encouraged management to do was make sure that they were bringing those ideas before they were fully baked.

Katie: So yeah, to give you an example, um, you know, we're thinking of expanding the footprint in the United States. Um. What does that look like? Well, you could wait until management's identified a, uh, a, a company that they're interested in, in speaking with, or you can start really early, educate the board on the market, educate the board on the market opportunities, identify some of the sweet spots of market opportunities, and then again, at the next meeting, come back with a deep dive on the places where, uh, the organization might like to play.

Katie: And then come back the following meeting with an update on what those, what that work has, has, uh, has [00:30:00] brought. And eventually you start to narrow the, uh, the aperture, um, in on things that are actually. Potentially actionable. Um, but by the time you get there, uh, the board has already understood the market, understood the, the, the, uh, the regions understood the candidates.

Katie: So, so really that elongating that strategic process. So there's no surprises. Um, it, it's very easy for the board to understand what's going on when they're given the opportunity in, in this case we're talking about an acquisition to consider something like that. But it, it would apply to, uh, to any number of strategic pivots, um, that an organization might wanna take.

David Beatty: And you had an offsite every year on strategy devoted Only to our, our long-term future. Yeah, we did every year, yes. And how did that work? What did you do in terms of that? Just the executives you bring in, outside people, different perspectives, or what did you do? 

Katie: Yes, we'd have a, um, a [00:31:00] usually in again, uh, um, a meeting that was not a quarter so we could take the time to, to devote to, uh, 

David Beatty: right 

Katie: to the agenda matters.

Katie: Obviously, strategy at these large organizations is not something that changes every year. Um, sometimes you're affirming something you decided to do last year. Sometimes you are per perhaps pivoting or extending your risk appetite slightly to, uh, to do, uh, to do some different, uh, some different things.

Katie: But really setting up the agenda so that you're focused in on, um. The areas that needed the most attention, whether that was because they were in a, in a state of change or they were going to be in a state of change. Um, and every year those generally would end up being, uh, a little bit different, but understanding the context of how that fit in to, again, the bigger picture.

Katie: Yep. So not just bringing the issue itself, but setting [00:32:00] the stage for, for what that means to the organization more broadly. 

David Beatty: Yeah. Yeah. Kathleen TaylorKathleen TaylorKathleen Taylor

Katie: Well, I can't speak to, uh, to what they're doing now, obviously. 

David Beatty: Yeah. 

Katie: But my own perspective on CEO succession, uh, planning is very similar to yours. Um, I do think that this is a critical, critical job the board has, and as a result, it's one that the board has to spend a lot of time on.

Katie: Um, and it's not something that can be rushed. You can't decide that you're going to engage in succession planning and hope to be finished 12 months from now. 

David Beatty: Yeah. 

Katie: Um, so I like to say that succession planning for a new CEO, um, begins the day. The current CEO starts the job. 

David Beatty: Oh, good for you. Yes. 

Katie: And and what do I mean by that?

Katie: I don't mean that we run out and hire consultants and start looking at desktop searches for potential replacements. No, I just, I just think that [00:33:00] we start to focus in on, uh, talent at the senior level, generational talent at the next level down. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Obviously, emergency succession planning is something that boards have to do anyway.

Katie: Um, as soon as you get a brand new CEO you have to worry about what would you do if, um, something happened. Right. And so active conversations around. Who might be the next generation of, of leaders in the bank who might then emerge as a, as a next generation CEO. Mm-hmm. Um, very, very important, but staying current on, on all of that.

Katie: And obviously the longer you are into the tenure of A CEO, the more intense those conversations become. Yeah. Um, but the, uh, the CEO, the head of hr, the other, um, the other business leaders, um, in the business, uh, are all very, very important players in [00:34:00] helping the board get the information it needs on the candidates who, who might be realistic, uh, successors to the senior team and the CEO.

David Beatty: And presumably building for them a program to enhance the skills that you might deem to be a little underdeveloped. 

Katie: Absolutely. Executive development, um, is a big part of this, uh, whether you choose to do that in-house Yeah. Or you choose to bring in an external service provider. I've done it both ways.

Katie: Um, and, uh, and, but ultimately you're, you're, you're there to try to give these next generation leaders the tools they need to grow. Um, and, and a lot of that, 70% of that is going to be, you know, on the job learning. Uh, some of it is going to be about transferring people from one vertical to another, because you can't, you can't generally, um, expect to become a senior leader in some of these very, very large roles, um, coming up essentially through, uh, through a [00:35:00] single job.

Katie: So making sure people are getting that diverse experience, um, getting them leadership opportunities. Outside the organization, whatever that might look like, whether it's heading the United Way campaign or serving on a hospital board, or potentially serving on a subsidiary board, rounding them out so that they, um, have a place where their own leadership skills can, uh, can shine.

David Beatty: Yeah. You might, this might be a little, um, a little challenging, but I was, you ran Four Seasons hotels for over 20 years, and you were there for a longer time. It is the greatest company in the world, in my view, consistent luxury service, still working on Izzy's principle, as do unto others. As you would be done by Yes.

David Beatty: If you think about their hiring processes, their selection of executive processes, their training, what I, what ideas were you able to bring over to the Royal Bank? Uh, from that, because I think the single [00:36:00] greatest company I've ever come across is the Four Seasons and you build it. So what lessons from that come across to the Royal Bank as, as a chair?

Katie: Well, once again, I'm going to violently agree with you, David. I do think that, uh, that Four Seasons is, uh, perhaps the greatest, uh, Canadian export story. Um, and, uh, because it's not only, uh, a great company, it's a, it's a company. That's great. In today, I think 45 different countries, right? Yeah, that's right.

Katie: It's, it's truly an, an amazing story. And it is a people story. It's a, it's a people story about leadership. Uh, I often refer to Four Seasons as a talent factory. What do I mean by that? Um, the way the business works is that we need the best people in the whole world in order to be successful at each property.

Katie: Yeah. How do we get those people? We can grow them. We can, we can recruit them. But ultimately that focus on [00:37:00] the very, very, very best people was unrelenting. Who we hired, how we trained. Um, it, it was, it was just a constant reverberation. And of course, the way the, the business works is that hotels by nature are very, very pyramidical.

Katie: Yeah. So to get that top job, um, you have to come through a lot of different doors and be successful at all of them to get there. And not everybody is. But when you think about our business model, we manage the hotels on behalf of third parties. Yep. The constraint on our growth. Was not necessarily capital.

Katie: Yes, we had to go out and find people that wanted to build these very, very expensive hotels and resorts. But from our perspective, the main governor on our growth was, did we have the people, the human capital, required to open that hotel in Baku successfully? Because you and I know most of the people we [00:38:00] hired into that hotel came from Baku.

Katie: But how was it gonna become a world class four seasons? And I'm picking, I'm picking that one just because lots of people have not been there. Um, but it would be true in Mumbai, it would be true in B, it would be true in the second hotel in Boston. It's the same everywhere. How do you get a great team put in place?

Katie: You need great leadership. Um, yeah. And so I would say, you know, my time at Four Seasons just taught me over and over and over again, both in success and sometimes in not so successful that nothing compares to the importance of great leadership anywhere. 

David Beatty: Yeah, I, you know, after 25 years of teaching strategy at the, uh, Rotman School, that's my one long-term differentiator for success would be the quality of the talent you have in your organization, number one.

David Beatty: I agree. I think it's just, there's all kinds of other things happening in the world, but if you don't have great people in your organization, you're not gonna have consistent long term results, in my view. [00:39:00] Totally agree. Um, let's move then from for profit. And move into sick kids where you've been for three and a half years now, the chair, and before that you were the chair of the foundation.

David Beatty: Mm-hmm. Describe some of the differences between being the chair of a not-for-profit in the case of the hospital, versus being the chair of a huge, vast international organization. What differences exist? Sure. 

Katie: Yeah. Well, they're not, I would say not as many differences as people might perceive there to be.

Katie: Ah-huh. Okay. Um, obviously when you're chairing a foundation, you are essentially the, uh, the, uh, chief fundraiser for the Yeah. Uh, for the organization. And, uh, I was at the Sick Kids Foundation. I joined in 2004. I'm actually still cross appointed there, here, uh, all 20 plus years later. Um, but it's a, it's a very, very big undertaking.

Katie: And in the case of sick kids, um, both of the, the foundation board and the hospital board are relatively sizable boards, um, with a lot of. Very high profile [00:40:00] people. We are very lucky to have, have the ability to attract incredible, uh, colleagues to those boards. The hospital mm-hmm. Is a big, complex, uh, place.

Katie: Um, obviously hospital boards are, uh, particularly, uh, special because of their life saving, uh, capabilities. Uh, right, right. Um, it's, uh, it's, it's not the same as the kind of business you're running day in, day out where, uh, where human life is not on the line. It is. It is for sure in a hospital, whether that's through the great work of the doctors or safety as, as a, as a really, really big, uh, big issue.

Katie: Um, the board of, of, uh, of sick kids, and I'm sure this is true of other hospital boards as well. We have a lot of committees, um, that are, uh, that are steered by, uh, my very capable, uh, very capable chairs. I think if I'm right, it's about seven committees in total. Um, so it's really, really, it's a [00:41:00] very, very busy board, very busy board.

Katie: We run a complex research institute. We have a quality and safety committee, which, uh, which you wouldn't normally see, um, in. Uh, in a, in a financial institution as an example, you would per perhaps, perhaps in, in mining, in, in manufacturing, in, in those, in those sorts of places. But then more traditional committees, audit, hr, uh, governance, um, would all, uh, would all fall into, uh, into those, uh, into those categories.

Katie: Um, real estate and facilities is, is again, something that you have to worry about. Yeah. Um, so they're, they're very, very complicated. The, the meetings are, uh, uh, the same. Constraints as in a public company, you've got a certain amount of time, you've got a lot to get through. Um, uh, lot of important information agenda management.

Katie: Back to our conversation from earlier. Yeah. Incredibly important and board effectiveness. Um, you, you've just gotta keep on top of making sure you've [00:42:00] got the best directors, the best management team, you've got a, a succession planning, both board and management looks very similar. So, uh, 

David Beatty: yeah. 

Katie: So it's, uh, it, it really is fantastic work.

Katie: I would encourage anyone who's, uh, who's interested in starting their board career in the not-for-profit to, to take this up. Um, you will learn enormous, uh, amounts of, uh, of, um, skills around governance and, and, uh, and just what it, what it takes to be a great board member. Um, it's a wonderful, uh, it's a wonderful, uh, place to not only train yourself, but also to give back.

David Beatty: It also sounds more challenging in your description of it than, say, even running the largest company in Canada that's publicly traded 

Katie: in some respects, it can be, you know, when, when, uh, last in the fall when you've got RSV and flu season, and you can read in the paper what's happening in emergency departments.

Katie: Um, yes, the, the stress on the management team is, uh, is very, very [00:43:00] intense and, uh, and so you're staying in touch with, uh, your CEO there, just the same way you're staying in touch with your CEO at, at, at a large, uh, at a large corporate. But because they don't have as much, um, infrastructure, um, as a, as a big, uh, big one of the big five Canadian banks, um, you're, you're probably, uh, you're relying on the board and the board members for a lot of additional, uh, a lot of additional work well beyond fundraising.

David Beatty: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure that's right. Well, um, I'm gonna ask Quinn if there are any questions that came across, um, in the last few minutes about, about Katie, her career and her advice. 

Quinn Lawson: Um, can you please share some tools to invite comments from quiet members so that not the same out, you know, someone adding too much value, uh, continues to do so 

Katie: Sure.

Katie: With, with your quiet members. There's a couple of things. Um, uh, I, I [00:44:00] do, I keep track of everyone who, who speaks and in what order. Um, I then make a point when it's time, maybe for a second round or we're moving on to a new topic. I try to make a point of not going back to the same people. In the same order.

Katie: I try to mix it up and see if I can get some of the quieter people up to the top of the list, um, in, uh, in a more effective fashion. Um, at the, uh, at the end of a session, if someone hasn't spoken at all, I might look over to them. Uh, anything you'd like to add? Sometimes tough when you put people on the spot and they're not, they're not expecting that.

Katie: Um, but there's ways to, you know, kind of read the room and know, um, what what might, uh, what might be encouraged. Um, I think the, uh, the other thing I would say is that back to colleague interaction, whether it's part of the formal evaluation process or not, um, as I said, you're staying in [00:45:00] touch with your colleagues all the time.

Katie: And if you've got someone who you think can be contributing more, but is not, so I'll give give you a, a typical example is you've, uh, got somebody who's come onto your board. They've got a very strong vertical, let's pick technology here for a second, um, because that's, uh, that's so topical and maybe it's AI today.

Katie: But, but the, but the idea is they come with this strong vertical and that's what they've been recruited on, making sure that they know that their, their repertoire is much broader than their vertical. Um, they're not there to simply be the technology or the AI or the real estate or whatever their background expertise is.

Katie: They're there to be a contributing director across. It doesn't have to be on every issue, but on all the issues where they have, they have something to contribute of value. And I often say to people, we just need more of you at the [00:46:00] next meeting. Yeah. Um, and however you decide to show up, that's what we'd like to see.

Katie: People, people would like to see more of you and understand more of what you're thinking.

Quinn Lawson: Um, thanks for that answer. Um, what would you say is the most precious support that you receive from a corporate secretary sec secretary's role. 

Katie: Hmm. Corporate secretary's role to me is one of the most important facets of an effective board. So if your corporate secretary is not the strongest, um, you're, you're ultimately going to always be leaving something behind.

Katie: Um, corporate secretary is the inside person to negotiate with everybody around time allocation, around agendas, you know, uh, board secretary come back to me and say, [00:47:00] oh, audit needs another hour. Why, and then she'd have to go back and, and because that hour back to finite time for a board, that hour has to be somebody else's hour that gets given up.

Katie: It's, it's not, it's not like you can just say, oh, well, we'll, we'll extend the board meeting for four days and just let people know. Um, doesn't work like that. Um, and so I would say time management, um, and, and agenda setting. The, the corporate secretary, super important as the board chair's voice. And I always used to say the corporate secretary, feel free, free to take my name in vain, um, because we've gotta make sure, um, this is a great board meeting.

Katie: I think the other, um, aspect to, to a great corporate secretary is just, um, providing me with, with all the things I can't see information, um, on, on the soft stuff. Not necessarily the hard stuff, but the soft stuff. Um, keeping me on time inside. The meeting [00:48:00] itself. Um, making sure I'm seeing what's going on in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a different way.

Katie: Um, but I, but I think, uh, the, uh, a really effective corporate secretary, and I've seen, I've seen this in, in real time in different boards, not, not RBC, 'cause I've always been blessed there with incredible corporate secretariat, um, group. And it's a, it's not just one corporate secretary, obviously. There, there's, there's a whole team of people, um, that are, that are working to keep the board on track.

Katie: Um, but the difference a great corporate secretary makes, cannot be underestimated. Question 

Quinn Lawson: during our question, during our prep call. Y you brought up educating not just the management, but the people below management around the function of a board. Can you mm-hmm. Bring up that, uh, story again and share that with everyone?

Katie: Of course. So David mentioned this earlier, um, and I'll, I'll rephrase it slightly, which is, I, uh, I, I say, man, [00:49:00] the board eats what? Management cooks, which is essentially Okay. The, the, the same, the same concept. So, so ultimately the, the, the idea that you need to have great materials, um, in order to have a great and and wonderfully functioning board is, is just, uh, it's just sort of.

Katie: Sounds, um, trite because it's so true. And if you, and if you get that piece wrong, then the board is coming, having reviewed all of those materials, which takes hours and hours and hours. And if they're not properly framed and they're not properly, uh, scoped, um, it can be an Easter egg hunt to try to figure out what's the most important thing I'm supposed to look at here.

Katie: Or it can be completely off point for what's going on in the, uh, in the meeting at that particular time. Um, so the, uh, you know, if we go [00:50:00] back to time being this, the scarce resource and, and building a little bit on some of the things David talked about earlier. You know, there's a great, um, phrase in management, which is, uh, success is 10% strategy and 90% execution.

Katie: We've all heard it. Yeah. Um, but. One of the aspects of that for a board is great execution, in my opinion is 90% planning and 10% doing. 

David Beatty: Hmm. 

Katie: And so if we think about our 10% being the time we spend together in plenary or in committee, um, the preparation for that should be nine times, um, the, the volume in order to try to get it right.

Katie: Um, and, uh, but that's a, that's an enormous undertaking to, uh, to, um, I don't sure if, I'm not sure if I fully answered your question though. 

Quinn Lawson: The, um, I, I'm not sure either. Um, I'm gonna invite [00:51:00] up, uh, another governance, uh, leader here, Jonathan Goodman to ask a quick question and then we will do wrap up. So this will be the last question.

Katie: Hi Jonathan. Hmm. 

David Beatty: You're not on Jonathan 

Guest: Quinn. I, it's on mute. Don't think I, I don't think I asked to ask a question, but that's okay. I found this. Did you just, did you cold call me Quinn? Is that what you just did? 

Quinn Lawson: You have your hand up, so, oh, well, 

Guest: I'm happy to ask. First of all, that was a masterclass to, uh, Kathleen and, and David.

Guest: So I can say that to both of you, uh, an excellent, uh, session together. Uh, what I'd be interested in, what, what's the one thing that a chair, uh, uh, someone who's looking or aspiring to be a chair should think about from their own standpoint? Not about the company, but about themselves and their temperament as to whether or [00:52:00] not they're gonna be a good fit, generally, lots that you've described specifically, but what's the general thing you'd say?

Katie: Well, I would say, um, a couple of things. I got a really terrific piece of advice from a colleague, uh, when I had been chosen as, uh, as the chair. And she said to me, the most important thing for you to remember is that you need to be the last among equals. Um, and, and it was a really powerful phrase because embedded in it is two thoughts.

Katie: The first is, um, you need to be the last. And what she meant by that was that as the chair, you have unparalleled access to the CEO to the management team, to the organization. We just finished talking about, um, the material prep, the corporate secretary. So you come to a meeting, um. Having a different level of, uh, understanding and preparation than everyone [00:53:00] else in the room.

Katie: And so your job, first of all, is to make sure that you're, you know, taking that step back and giving people the room they need to get caught up on, on the kinds of things that they have questions in the, in their minds. The second part of that phrase, um, last, uh, among equals is that. There's no boss of a board.

Katie: Um, as a CEO, you are the boss of a company, but on a board, um, it is a very democratic, uh, um, grouping. You're all elected by the shareholders equally. Um, the chair doesn't get special points, um, from, uh, from, from that perspective. And so this idea of needing to have very strong relationships with your colleagues who have essentially chosen you as a peer, um, to be their [00:54:00] organizational leader, uh, that again, they didn't.

Katie: Pick you to be their boss. They didn't pick you to tell them what to do. They want you to be their organizational leader and, and to be in charge of making the board effective. And to take on that role we started with of special liaison to the CEO. So they're gonna tell you all the things. They want you to tell the CEO and you're gonna figure out when and how to do those things.

Katie: So I think there's, there's that to it, a mindset around the positioning of what a chair is there for. Um, the second thing I would say, I just wanna flag 

Quinn Lawson: the time for you, Katie there. Okay. I'll be quick. 

Katie: The second, the second thing I would say is that you really need, as a, as if you're aspiring to be a chair, get yourself some leadership roles on the board because Yeah, that's incredibly important, not only for colleagues to see you in a leadership, uh, setting, but also for them to get comfortable with the idea that you can take on more.

Quinn Lawson: Thank you so much [00:55:00] Katie, and thank you David. Sorry if this feels rushed, but they've both made it clear that they have to run at 2:00 PM I, I want to flag, um, one a call to action for Katie. You can, if you're, if you appreciate this class today, if you appreciate her work, contribute to sick kids in their foundation.

Quinn Lawson: So there's that. I would also want to flag on February 2nd, we have a usual contributor, Nick Darbo Garo, who's going to not be talking about AI, but his other power expertise, which is around marketing and how boards, CEOs and top top management needs to think about growth in sales. So maybe Katie, I know that you're recognized as a marketer.

Quinn Lawson: Do you have a comment on what boards need to do around sales and marketing? 

Katie: Absolutely. The, I always say to people, uh, revenue only exists in one place. The pocket of the [00:56:00] customer, that's where it's at. Um, so if your company wants to get more of what's in the pocket of your customers, your clients, your guests, whatever that may be, um, you need to understand those strategies, the effectiveness of those strategies, and of course.

Katie: That whole landscape has changed hugely, um, since I started my work as a public company board, uh, member. And, uh, and ultimately boards really need to understand the effectiveness of the sales strategy, of the customer, outreach of the socials, everything that goes into customer, uh, customer relationships.

Katie: And Quinn, let me just say before we close, thank you for that shout out around sick kids. That's very kind. Uh, really appreciate it. And thanks again, David, for having me and for everyone for listening. 

David Beatty: Thank you, Katie. Thanks everybody. Happy New Year.
